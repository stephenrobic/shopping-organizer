# Shopping Organizer

## Application Description:
This is a web application designed to make the shopping and grocery planning experience a breeze. This web app can be used to manage and store recipes, lists (shopping, to-do, etc.), and in the future, your kitchen/ pantry inventory.

The intended future goal is to also receive recommendations of recipes that you already have ingredients for in your own personal pantry, or that require purchasing the fewest additional ingredients. Also intended, is for the app to alert ingredients are low or need to be purchased in your personal pantry.
