# shopping-organizer
This web app can be used to manage and store recipes, lists (shopping, to-do, etc.), and your kitchen inventory of
groceries.

The intended future goal is to also receive recommendations of recipes that you already have ingredients for,
or that require purchasing the fewest additional ingredients. Also intended, is for the app to alert when ingredients
are low or need to be purchased.
